# Tekton Hub

Tekton Hub is a web-based platform for developers to discover, share and
contribute tasks and pipelines. The hub provides detailed information about
tasks and pipelines. This helps the developer to build their CI/CD systems
without understanding too much implementation details of tasks and pipelines.

Tekton Hub also features tasks from different catalogs thereby making it a
one-stop-shop for reusable Tekton resources.
