# Experimental Tekton Components

Test EASYCLA

Welcome to the Tekton Experimental ðŸ§ª  components repo!

Tekton projects may start off in this repo so community members can
collaborate before
[promoting the project to a top level repo](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/process.md#promotion-from-experimental-to-top-level-repo).

The setup for this repo is a work in progress (https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/issues/3)
but the goal is that:

- Each project will have its own folder
- Each folder will have it's own [OWNERS](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/process.md#OWNERS)
  and [pull request automation](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/process.md#reviews)
