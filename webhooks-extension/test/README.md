# Testing and scripting

This directory will contain scripts used for several related purposes. 

- As a developer I want to set up a local test environment
  - From clean: install all prerequisites
  - Having prereqs installed, set up a pipeline and webhook for a simple test repository
- We'll want automated tests that do much the same things. 

This is a work in progress and will take a while to settle down. 

## Clean Docker Desktop: Install prereqs
