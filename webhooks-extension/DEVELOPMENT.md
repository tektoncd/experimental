# Developing

Involved development scripts and instructions can be found in the [development installation guide](https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/blob/master/webhooks-extension/test/README.md#scripting)

## UI development

Use `npm ci` when installing from source to install with a clean set of dependencies, if a node_modules folder is already present in the project root it will be automatically removed before install.

If modifying the UI code and wanting to deploy your updated version:

1) Run `npm run build` this will create a new file in the dist directory. Note that this does require `yq`, so grab that too
2) Reinstall the extension. It will automatically be picked up by the running dashboard. Use

```
kustomize build overlays/development | ko apply -f -
```

if developing on a plain Kubernetes system, or 

```
kustomize build overlays/openshift-development | ko apply -f -
```

if developing against OpenShift or OKD. 

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` to execute the linter. This will ensure code follows the conventions and standards used by the project.

Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix a number of types of problem including code style.

## Running tests

`GO_ENABLED=0 go test github.com/tektoncd/experimental/webhooks-extension/pkg/endpoints -v -race`

To run a specific test:
`GO_ENABLED=1 go test github.com/tektoncd/experimental/webhooks-extension/pkg/endpoints -v -race -run [test_name]`

## API Definitions

- [Extension API definitions](docs/DevelopmentAPIs.md)
  - The extension API endpoints can be accessed through the dashboard.

### Example creating a webhook

We would recommend using the extension via the Tekton Dashboard UI - however, for development purposes you can create your webhook using curl:

```bash
data='{
  "name": "go-hello-world",
  "namespace": "green",
  "gitrepositoryurl": "https://github.com/ncskier/go-hello-world",
  "accesstoken": "github-secret",
  "pipeline": "simple-pipeline",
  "dockerregistry": "mydockerregistry"
  "pulltask": "monitor-result-task",
  "onsuccesscomment": "OK",
  "onfailurecomment": "ERROR",
}'
curl -d "${data}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhooks
```
Whilst most parameters are mandatory the following three are optional. Not setting them will allow the defaults to take effect and this is recommended in most cases.

`pulltask`: task name that monitors the pipeline and updates the pull request when it finishes. The default task is `monitor-result-task`

`onsuccesscomment`: comment text that is put into the pull request when the pipelinerun finishes successfully.  The default is `OK: <pipelinerun name>`

`onfailurecomment`: comment text that is put into the pull request when the pipelinerun finishes with errors.  The default is `ERROR: <pipelinerun name>`

When curling through the dashboard, use the same endpoints; for example, assuming the dashboard is at `localhost:9097`:

```bash
curl -d "${data}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:9097/webhooks
```
